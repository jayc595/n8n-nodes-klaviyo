# n8n-nodes-klaviyo

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use the Klaviyo CRM service in your n8n workflows.

Klaviyo is a unified customer platform that empowers businesses to build smarter digital relationships through personalized email and SMS marketing, leveraging their own data to drive engagement and growth. It offers tools for automation, segmentation, and analytics, specifically designed for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands.

This project is a work in progress. Please feel free to submit feedback and requests for additional operations and I will add them as I have time.

## Credentials

If you don't already have a Klaviyo account, you can [sign up here](https://www.klaviyo.com/sign-up).

This node authenticates to the Klaviyo API and your account using a private key. Steps for obtaining this private key can be found in the [Klaviyo documentation](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423954176283).

Klaviyo API private key must have minimum permissions of Read Access to the Events resource to pass the authentication test.

## Compatibility

Tested on version 1.75.2, but likely will work on lower versions.
