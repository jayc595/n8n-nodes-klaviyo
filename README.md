# n8n-nodes-klaviyo

This repo contains nodes and credentials for connecting the Klaviyo CRM to [n8n](n8n.io).

This project is a work in progress. Please feel free to submit requests for additional operations and I will add them as I have time.

## Installation

Installation instructions for community nodes can be found in the [official n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

Once installed, credentials must be set up with your Klaviyo account for authentication. Your private key must have the minimum permissions of read access for events to pass verification.

Instructions for obtaining a Klaviyo API private key can be found in the [Klaviyo documentation](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423954176283).
